    <p style="font-size: 20px;">The college has two canteens where a variety of tasty, hygienically prepared food is available at specially subsidized rates. Whether it is breakfast, lunch, a quick snack or a cup of coffee, the canteen is where you need to head. Conveniently located in the college quadrangle and just outside the main gate, the two canteens are easily accessible to staff and visitors as well. It is a pleasant sight to see students spread out across the quadrangle, enjoying their food in groups.</p>
